negative,satisfaction,"My elderly mother was prescribed this medication in addition to insulin. Her blood sugar dropped so low she wound up in the ER after passing out. Also had been very nauseous with little appetite after a few months of use. I donâ€™t like her using this at all."
negative,satisfaction,"On this medication for 2 weeks. Gas had been the biggest change I noticed right away. For the past 2 days my skin got itchy and I am now covered in several patches of hives! Getting off this RX. Tried because my Janumet RX was $600 for 90 days with the coupon1 So my Dr. tried Metformin which is a generic. Unfortunately Metformin not going to work for me."
negative,satisfaction,"This medication caused my blood sugar to drop so low that I ended up in the ER not knowing who I was or what I was doing. I hated it."
negative,satisfaction,"I took 1 dose, and my entire GI system suffered. I started with stomach cramps, which led to extremely watery bowels as well as painful bowels and nausea. That night my stomach was so distended I couldn\'t sleep and every time I turned over I could feel the gases shift. Pain was a 10 out of 10. It took 4 days to get my body back to normal."
negative,satisfaction,"I started taking this twice a day. 500 mg twice a day. Before I started taking it my a1c was 7.3. After 3 or 4 months my a1c is now 6.2. I had no bad side effects at first. My bowel movements were hard but thats about it. It has now been 3 or 4 months and I am sick to my stomach. I have explosive diarrhea now and cannot leave the bathroom. I have to work for a living so I had to quit taking it. My stomach grumbles so loudly it sounds like there is a war going on inside my stomach! I dont know how long it takes til its out of my system but OMG I am still having some symptoms. Not sure why after 3 or 4 months I would start having bad side effects. I use my test strips to test multiple times a day and my blood sugars are still good so I think the metformin is still in my system. I will have to contact my doc to let her know I quit taking it and need something else. Hopefully there is something else she can give me."
negative,satisfaction,"After being put on 2 pills of 750 mg at night, I became ill after a few weeks with a \"mysterious\" illness that no one could figure out. Uncontrollable high blood pressure which sent me to the ER -190/107 which is not good for a brain aneurysm survivor. Headaches, nausea, severe leg cramping, bladder failure and then finally stomach aches. I kept being sent for more tests and specialists. I finally read the reviews here and decided to stop this med cold turkey. I slowly got better and now 2 1/2 weeks later all the symptoms are gone. My GP (who did not prescribe this) has just listed this in my official record that I am allergic to it. Awful stuff - I have never been so scared about what was wrong with me. I am now under the care of a nephrologist to make sure my blood pressure is controlled - I now have stage 3 kidney disease."
positive,satisfaction,"i have been taking this meds 500 mg 2x/day for a week. no side effect at all for me. i\'ve lost 1.5 lbs in a week!"
positive,satisfaction,"Blood glucose ranging from 170-300 both AM and PM. A1C consistently at ~7.0. Now on Metformin 1000mgX2 for 2 weeks. One day of diarrhea. No response yet but hoping for drops in number. Allergic to all forms of exercise so relying on diet and medicine."
positive,satisfaction,"I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes 1.5 months ago. My A1C was 15.8, Urine Glucose over 500 (test max) and my first home blood glucose test was 577. My doctor had me start with one 500mg ER tablet a day for the first week, then two a day since then. I also was prescribed a 5mg tablet of glipizide a day. My Blood Glucose has been in the 85-150 range the past month. I have modified my diet some. I did experience some diarrhea, though am over it now."
positive,satisfaction,"Type II diabetic/64 years old/take 2000mg (2- 500 @ night 2-500mg @ day) A1c down from 9 to 7.1. Also take Januvia. No side effects, but does keep your bowels moving. A1c is the critical reading not the momentary glucose. Works for me, but I know it can be troublesome for others. Talk to your Dr."
positive,satisfaction,"Diagnosed with diabetes 3 years ago placed on metformin twice/day 1000mg/ 6 monthsago my a1c was dropping significantly. Last a1c was 4.3 decreased my dose to 500mg daily. Dr so pleased and wants to repeat a1c in 3 months if remains low stop medication altogether! YEAH!"
positive,satisfaction,"i have taken 2000 per day for 25 years. now i have to stop because i have diarrhea. booting.i stopped it and the symptoms went away"
positive,satisfaction,"I used to gag on my metformin pills they smelled so bad. But I found a brand, Zydus Pharmaceuticals, which doesn\'t smell and have not had a problem since. I had to have CVS special order them. Make sure it\'s marked with a z on one side and the number 70 on the reverse."
